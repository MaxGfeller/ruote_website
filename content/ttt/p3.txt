h3. back to the first draft

<img src="../images/ttt/initial_process.png" align="right" />This is what our process looks like as a pseudo UML diagram :

It's time to translate that into something the OpenWFEru workflow engine directly understands. 

The first version of the process definition will be XML based :

<% coderay(:lang => 'xml', :line_numbers => 'inline') do -%>
<process-definition name="TeaTesting" revision="0.1">
  <sequence>
    <participant ref="Reception" />
    <participant ref="Ted" />
    <participant ref="Tang" />
    <participant ref="Takeshi" />
    <participant ref="PlanningTeam" />
  </sequence>
</process-definition>
<% end -%>

This looks very simplistic. But it carries the essence of the process as currently carried out in [our imaginary] organization.

<img src="../images/ttt/conc_process.png" align="right" />Since each participant of that business process currently takes 2 days for each sample (with 5 or 6 samples in parallel), why not try to make the process more efficient by at least removing two days -&gt;

Your first impulse drew you to make the 3 wisemen tests run concurrently, but the Manager decided to place Takeshi-san test last.

<% coderay(:lang => 'xml', :line_numbers => 'inline') do -%>
<process-definition name="TeaTesting" revision="0.2">
  <sequence>
    <participant ref="reception" />
    <concurrence>
      <participant ref="ted" />
      <participant ref="tang" />
    </concurrence>
    <participant ref="takeshi" />
    <participant ref="planning" />
  </sequence>
</process-definition>
<% end -%>

From 10 days down to 8 days. "We're in no hurry, at least for that one".

Let's <b>save</b> that process definition in a file named "teatesting_0.2.xml":../defs/ttt/teatesting_0.2.xml

We now have <b>1 process definition</b> with <b>5 participants</b>, can we run that process definition ?
