This is meant to be read sequentially. It's the story of the implementation of a business process. 

Disclaimer : I have no idea of the business of tea, this example is completely made up. I simply hope it will feel less boring than a "holiday request" or "expense sheet" example.

h3. before commencing

This is meant to be a step by step implementation of an example business process on top of OpenWFEru (and its demo Ruby on Rails integration, Densha).

OpenWFEru ('Rufus' for short) is a an open source <b>workflow engine</b> written, if you don't need such a tool please go look elsewhere. And if you simply need to bind a state that takes values like "approved", "unpublished", "revised" to a simple ActiveRecord model, you're probably better off with a tool like "act_as_a_statemachine":http://github.com/rubyist/aasm

If you need a <b>workflow engine</b> where business processes are a first-class concept that you can define, launch, pause, cancel, ... then maybe you should read on and Rufus may be a tool for you.

This example uses Densha, a Ruby on Rails integration of Rufus (OpenWFEru), but please remember that you can use Rufus outside of a Rails application (these days, I use it at work inside Tomcat thanks to "JRuby":http://jruby.org)

If you feel that some part of this guide should be enhanced/clarified/extended or if you simply have a question, please seek for help on the "OpenWFEru users mailing list":http://groups.google.com/group/openwferu-users


h3. the 'tea testing team' example

This example is based on a presentation I gave in February 2007. At this point, Rufus was only 4 months old and there was no Rails integration.

Please remember that Rufus is the workflow engine and that Densha is an integration example of it within a Ruby on Rails application.


h3. how the example is divided

<ul>
<% TITLES.each_with_index do |(title, description), index| 
    description = "this page" if index == 0
%>
<li>"<%= title %>":p<%= index %>.html : <%= description %></li>
<% end %>
</ul>

<%= render_next_page %>
<%= render_questions %>
