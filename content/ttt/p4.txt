h3. out of the box

Out of the box, ruote-web (ex "Densha") comes with a bunch of pre-defined users, groups, stores and launch permissions.

* users : they are ruote-web users, ie they can log in into the ruote-web web application, modify workitems proceed them and eventually launch new processes
* groups : a way of grouping users. They may used to gather them in roles, teams, units, whatever
* stores : they are sets of workitems. When arriving from the workflow engine to the worklist, regular expression matching is used to determine in which store a workitem should be placed.
* store permissions : are used to grant read/write/delegate rights to groups of users on stores.
* launch permissions : each user group can be granted launch rights, "launching" is about creating a new instance of a business process based on a given process definition. A launch permission maps a user group to a process definition URL.

Still out of the box, ruote-web features a store "users" with special rules.

All these concepts are ruote-web concepts, not OpenWFEru concepts.


h3. what we need

We have four participants, why not stay simple and use only five users ? Thus we can leverage the properties of the "users" store.

<%= thumbnail("../images/ttt/wa_screen.png", 40, :right) %>That makes five regular users plus one admin user.

All the workitems will get routed to the "users" store, provided that their participant name matches one of the user names.

Launch permissions are connected to user groups, the only user[s] that has to launch processes is the 'reception' user, let's create a unique group for 'reception'. 

Then add a launch permission to the local URL '/process_definitions/teatesting_0.2.xml' for this 'reception' group.

(you can use the upload process definition functionality in the worklist screen of ruote-web to upload the process definition and have its launch permission added on the fly)

(click on the image on the right to see the resulting settings)

Here is a summary :

* 5 regular users (reception, ted, tang, takeshi, planning) plus 1 admin user
* 1 group (reception)
* no store permissions (relying on the implicit permissions on the special 'users' workitem store
* 1 launch permission for the group 'reception' on '/process_definitions/teatesting_0.2.xml' 

The interface of this "worklist admin" screen should be quite obvious, hit '-' (minus) to remove an entry and '+' (plus) to add/confirm a new one.
