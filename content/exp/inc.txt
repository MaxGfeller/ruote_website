h2. inc


Increments or decrements the value found in a process variable or
a workitem field.

One points to a var or a field in these various ways :

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  sequence do
    inc :var => 'counter'
    inc :field => 'counter'
    inc 'v:counter'
    inc 'f:counter'
  end
</pre>

'inc' and 'dec' work with two types of values : numbers (the default) and
arrays.


h3. numbers

The vanilla case of inc/dec is increasing/decreasing a value by 1.

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  dec :var => 'x'
</pre>

will decrease the value in variable 'x' by 1.

inc/dec works with two kind of numbers, integers and floats.

If the target var or field is not set, it will be assumed to be at zero.

The default increment is 1 (or 1.0 for floats). It can be changed by
passing a value to the inc/dec expression.

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  inc 'v:x', :val => 3
  inc 'v:y', :val => 2.4

</pre>

h3. arrays

inc/dec can be used to push/pop elements in arrays held in process variables
or workitem fields.

This fragment of process definition

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  sequence do
    set 'v:x' => %w[ a b c d ]
    repeat do
      dec 'v:x', :pos => 'head'
      _break :unless => '${v:d}'
      participant '${v:d}'
    end
  end
</pre>

is equivalent to

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  iterator :on => 'a, b, c, d', :to_var => 'x' do
    participant '${v:x}'
  end
</pre>

More details : the inc expression expects a value and it will place it
at the end of the current array. The :pos or :position attribute can
be set to 'head' to let the inc expression place the value at the head
of the array.

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  set 'v:x' => [ 'alfred', 'bryan' ]
  set 'v:customer_name' => 'charles'

  inc 'v:x', :val => '${v:customer_name}'
    # the variable 'x' now holds [ 'alfred', 'bryan', 'charles' ]
  inc 'v:y', :val => '${v:customer_name}', :pos => 'head'
    # the variable 'x' now holds [ 'charles', 'alfred', 'bryan', 'charles' ]
</pre>

The 'dec' / 'decrement' variant of the expression will remove the tail
value (by default) of the array, or the head value if :pos is set to 'head'.

It's also possible to remove a specific value by passing it to 'dec' :

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  set 'v:x' => [ 'alfred', 'bryan', 'carl' ]
  dec 'v:x', :val => 'bryan'
    # the variable 'x' now holds [ 'alfred', 'carl' ]
</pre>

'dec' places the removed value in the local variable named 'd'. This trick
was used in the above iterator example.

A specific variable or field can be specified via the :to_var / :to_field
attributes :

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  dec 'v:x', :to_v => 'a'
  participant :ref => '${v:a}'
</pre>
