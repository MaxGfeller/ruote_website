title: participant expression

h2. participant


The 'participant' expression is very special. It sits on the fence between
the engine and the external world.

The participant expression is used to pass workitems to participants
from the engine. Those participants are bound at start time (usually) in
the engine via its register_participant method.

Here's an example of two concurrent participant expressions in use :

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  concurrence do
    participant :ref => 'alice'
    participant :ref => 'bob'
  end
</pre>

Upon encountering the two expressions, the engine will lookup their name
in the participant map and hand the workitems to the participant instances
registered for those names.


h3. attributes passed as arguments

All the attributes passed to a participant will be fed to the outgoing
workitem under a new 'params' field.

Thus, with

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  participant :ref => 'alice', :task => 'maw the lawn', :timeout => '2d'
</pre>

Alice will receive a workitem with a field params set to

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  { :ref => 'alice', :task => 'maw the lawn', :timeout => '2d' }
</pre>

The fields named 'params' will be deleted before the workitems resumes
in the flow (with the engine replying to the parent expression of this
participant expression).


h3. simplified participant notation

This process definition is equivalent to the one above. Less to write.

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  concurrence do
    participant 'alice'
    bob
  end
</pre>

Please note that 'bob' alone could stand for the participant 'bob' or
the subprocess named 'bob'. Subprocesses do take precedence over
participants (if there is a subprocess named 'bob' and a participant
named 'bob'.


h3. participant defined timeout

Usually, timeouts are given for an expression in the process definition.

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  participant 'alice', :timeout => '2d'
</pre>

where alice as two days to complete her task (send back the workitem).

But it's OK for participant classes registered in the engine to provide
their own timeout value. The participant instance simply has to reply to
the #rtimeout method and provide a meaningful timeout value (like a
number of seconds, or a string like "2d" or "1M2w".

Note however, that the process definition timeout (if any) will take
precedence over the participant specified one.


h3. asynchronous

The expression will make sure to dispatch to the participant in an
asynchronous way. This means that the dispatch will occur in a dedicated
thread.

Since the dispatching to the participant could take a long time and block
the engine for too long, this 'do thread' policy is used by default.

If the participant itself replies to the method #do_not_thread and replies
positively to it, a new thread (or a next_tick) won't get used. This is
practical for tiny participants that don't do IO and reply immediately
(after a few operations). By default, BlockParticipant instances do not
thread.
