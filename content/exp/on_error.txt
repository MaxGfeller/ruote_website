h2. on_error


Up until ruote 2.2.1, 'on_error' was only an attribute

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  sequence :on_error => 'error_handler' do
    # ...
  end
</pre>

This 'on_error' expression makes such definitions possible

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  sequence do
    on_error /unknown participant/ => 'missing_participant'
    on_error 'decommission'
    # ...
  end
</pre>

where errors containing 'unknown participant' in their messages are handled
by the participant or subprocess named 'missing participant', while
the rest of the errors is handled by the participant or the subprocess
named 'decommission'.

Speaking of subprocesses, this is also possible

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  sequence do

    on_error /unknown participant/ do
      admin :msg => 'there was an unknown participant'
    end
    on_error do
      # decommissioning...
    end

    # ...
  end
</pre>
