h2. undo


Undoes (cancels) another expression referred by its tag.

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  pdef = Ruote.process_definition do
    concurrence do
      alpha :tag => 'kilroy'
      undo :ref => 'kilroy'
    end
  end
</pre>

This example is rather tiny, but it shows a process branch (undo) cancelling
another (alpha).

h3. cancel

This expression is aliased to 'cancel'

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  cancel :ref => 'invoicing_stage'
</pre>
