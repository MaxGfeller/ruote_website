h2. that


The 'that' and the 'of' expressions are used in conjuction with
the 'given' expression (GivenExpression).

In can be used 'standalone', it thus becomes then merely an 'if'.

The children of the that/of are executed if the condition evaluates to
true. The children are executed one by one, as if the that/of were
a sequence.

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  given '${status}' do
    that '${location} == CH' do
      set 'f:bank' => 'UBS'
      subprocess 'buy_chocolate'
    end
    of 'ready' do
      participant 'saleshead', :msg => 'customer ready'
      participant 'salesman', :task => 'visiter customer'
    end
    of 'over' do
      participant 'manager', :msg => 'process over'
    end
  end
</pre>

(Yes, I know, it's a poor example).
