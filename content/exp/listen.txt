title: listen expression

h2. listen


Listens for activity (incoming or outgoing workitems) on a (set of)
participant(s).

This expression is an advanced one. It allows for cross process instance
communication or at least cross branch communication within the same
process instance.

DO NOT confuse the listen expression with the 'listener' concept. They are
not directly related. The listen expression listens to workitem activity
inside of the engine, while a listener listens for workitems or launchitems
from sources external to the ruote workflow engine.

It can be used in two ways : 'blocking' or 'triggering'. In both cases
the listen expression 'reacts' upon activity (incoming or outgoing workitem)
happening on a channel (a participant name or a tag name).

h3. blocking

A blocking example :

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  sequence do
    participant 'alice'
    listen :to => 'bob'
    participant 'charly'
  end
</pre>

Once the listen expression got applied, this process will block until a
workitem (in any other process instance in the same engine) is dispatched
to participant 'bob'. It then proceeds to charly.

h3. triggering

This way of using 'listen' is useful for launching processes that "stalk"
other processes :

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  Ruote.process_definition :name => 'stalker' do
    listen :to => 'bob' do
      participant :ref => 'charly'
    end
  end
</pre>

This small process will never exits and will send a workitem to charly
each time the ruote engine sends a workitem to bob.

The workitems passed to charly will be copies of the workitem initially
applied to the 'listen' expression, but with a copy of the fields of the
workitem passed to bob, merged in.

Note : for now, the triggered segments of processes are 'forgotten'. The
'listen' expression doesn't keep track of them. This also means that in
case of cancel, the triggered segments will not get cancelled.

h3. :merge

By default, :merge is set to true, the listened for workitems see their
values merged into a copy of the workitem held in the listen expression
and this copy is delivered to the expressions that are client to the
'listen'.

h3. :upon

There are two kinds of main events in ruote, apply and reply. Thus,
a listen expression may listen to 'apply' and to 'reply' and this is
defined by the :upon attribute.

By default, listens upon 'apply' (engine handing workitem to participant).

Can be set to 'reply', to react on workitems being handed back to the
engine by the participant.

Setting :upon to 'entering' or 'leaving' tells the listen to focus on
tag events.

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  sequence do
    sequence :tag => 'phase_one' do
      alpha
    end
    sequence :tag => 'phase_two' do
      bravo
    end
  end
</pre>

In this dummy process definition, there are four tag events :

* 'entering' 'phase_one'
* 'leaving' 'phase_one'
* 'entering' 'phase_two'
* 'leaving' 'phase_two'


h3. :to and :on

The :to attribute has already been seen, it can be replaced by the :on one.

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  listen :to => 'alpha'
</pre>

is equivalent to

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  listen :on => 'alpha'

</pre>

h3. :to (:on) and regular expressions

It's OK to write things like :

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  listen :to => "/^user\_.+/"
</pre>

or

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  listen :to => /^user\_.+/
</pre>

To listen for workitems for all the participant whose name start with
"user_".


h3. :wfid

By default, a listen expression listens for any workitem/participant event
in the engine. Setting the :wfid attribute to 'true' or 'same' or 'current'
will make the listen expression only care for events belonging to the
same process instance (same wfid).


h3. :where

The :wfid can be considered a 'guard'. Another tool for guarding listen
is to use the :where attribute.

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  listen :to => 'alpha', :where => '${customer.state} == CA'
</pre>

The listen will trigger only if the workitem has a customer field with
a subfield state containing the value "CA".

The documentation about the dollar notation and the one about common
attributes :if and :unless applies for the :where attribute.
