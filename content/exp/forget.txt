title: forget expression

h2. forget


Forgets all of its children.

This expression is somehow deprecated in favour of the :forget attribute
that any expression understands.

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  sequence do
    participant 'alpha'
    forget do
      sequence do
        participant 'bravo'
        participant 'charly'
      end
    end
    participant 'delta'
  end
</pre>

In this example above, the flow goes from alpha to bravo and delta. The
bravo-charly segment is independent of the main process flow. Charly's
reply will be forgotten.

Now the equivalent process definition, but using the :forget attribute :

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  sequence do
    participant 'alpha'
    sequence :forget => true do
      participant 'bravo'
      participant 'charly'
    end
    participant 'delta'
  end
</pre>

This expression can be useful for fire-and-forget parallelism in processes.
