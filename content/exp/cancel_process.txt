title: cancel_process expression

h2. cancel_process


Cancels a whole process instance.

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  pdef = Ruote.process_definition :name => 'test' do
    sequence do
      participant :ref => 'editor'
      concurrence do
        participant :ref => 'reviewer1'
        participant :ref => 'reviewer2'
        sequence do
          participant :ref => 'main_reviewer'
          cancel_process :if => '${f:over} == true'
        end
      end
      participant :ref => 'editor'
    end
  end
</pre>

This example has a 'main_reviewer' with the ability to cancel the whole
process, if he sets the workitem field 'over' to 'true'.

If the goal is to cancel only a segment of a process instance, the
expression 'undo' (Ruote::Exp::UndoExpression) is better suited.
