h2. filter


Filter is a one-way filter expression. It filters workitem fields.
Validations and Transformations are possible.

There are two ways to use it. With a single rule or with an array of
rules.

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  filter 'x', :type => 'string'
    # will raise an error if the field 'x' doesn't contain a String
</pre>

or

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  filter :in => [
    { :field => 'x', :type => 'string' },
    { :field => 'y', :type => 'number' }
  ]
</pre>

For the remainder of this piece of documentation, the one rule filter
will be used.
