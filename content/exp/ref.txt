title: ref expression

h2. ref


Sometimes you don't know at 'design time', if you want to trigger a
participant or subprocess.

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  Ruote.process_definition do
    sequence do
      participant 'alice'
      ref '${solver}'
      participant 'charlie'
    end
  end
</pre>

In this process, solver's name could be a participant name or a subprocess
name.

Subprocesses have the priority over participants.

Note : this expression is used by the worker when substituting unknown
expression names with participant or subprocess refs.
