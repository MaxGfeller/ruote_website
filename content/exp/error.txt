h2. error


This error is used by the 'error' expression, when an error is triggered
from the process definition.


Triggers an error directly from the process definition.

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  Ruote.process_definition :name => 'log1' do
    sequence do
      perform_inventory
      error 'inventory issue', :if => '${f:level} < 1'
      order_new_stuff
      store_new_stuff
    end
  end
</pre>

Replaying the error will 'unlock' the process.

h3. re[raise] (since ruote 2.3.1)

The re or reraise attribute can be used to bring back an error
placed in a workitem field or a process variable and raise it
again.

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  Ruote.define do

    define 'handler' do
      set 'f:err' => '$f:__error__'
    end
    sequence :on_error => 'handler' do
      error 'fail!'
    end

    # error was intercepted and is now stashed in
    # workitem field 'err'

    error :re => '$f:err'
  end
</pre>
