h2. workflow control patterns

The "Workflow Patterns":http://workflowpatterns.com/patterns/control/index.php are a catalog of various building blocks for workflow execution.

Described here are ways to implement each of those patterns with ruote. Some of them are not directly realizable with ruote, approximations are proposed. This is a self-evaluation, for an authoritative voice, the workflow patterns website and its "mailing list":http://groups.google.com/group/workflow-patterns are here.

Each pattern is illustrated with a Ruby DSL implementation (or approximation). XML implementations are easily derivable from their Ruby counterparts. There is also a link to the original pattern explanation and its flash animation.

Participant expressions have been supplemented with an :activity attribute to give a better feel about an hypothetical context for the application of the pattern.

h2(#basic). Basic Control Flow Patterns

<!-- H3 -->

h3(#ba_sequence). sequence

Chaining activities in sequence. Uses the "sequence":exp/sequence.html expression. The "cursor":exp/cursor.html expression might also be used.

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  sequence do
    participant :ref => 'alpha', :activity => 'write'
    participant :ref => 'bravo', :activity => 'fix typos'
  end
</pre>

"original pattern explanation":http://workflowpatterns.com/patterns/control/basic/wcp1.php | "top":#top

<!-- H3 -->

h3(#ba_parallel_split). parallel split

The "concurrence":exp/concurrence.html expression is the main tool for 'parallel splits'.

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  concurrence do
    participant :ref => 'alpha', :activity => 'write introduction'
    participant :ref => 'bravo', :activity => 'write postface'
  end
</pre>

"original pattern explanation":http://workflowpatterns.com/patterns/control/basic/wcp2.php | "top":#top

<!-- H3 -->

h3(#ba_synchronization). synchronization

Synchronization is "supported implicitely":#ba_parallel_split by the "concurrence":exp/concurrence.html expression. Note that this expression can be tuned via its attributes for behaviours different than the vanilla "wait before all child expressions have replied" one.

"original pattern explanation":http://workflowpatterns.com/patterns/control/basic/wcp3.php | "top":#top

<!-- H3 -->

h3(#ba_exclusive_choice). exclusive choice

Exclusive 'routing' within the process : the flow will go one way or the other, but not both.

The "if":exp/if.html is usually in charge when implementing this pattern (the underscore '_' prefixing the if prevents collision with the 'if' Ruby keyword).

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  _if '${f:decision} == accepted' do
    participant :ref => 'alpha', :activity => 'request further info'
    participant :ref => 'alpha', :activity => 'send refusal note'
  end
</pre>

(this if example forwards the flow to the same 'alpha' participant, but with different activities).

One could rewrite this as :

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  sequence do
    participant 'alpha', :activity => 'request further info', :if => '${f:decision} == accepted'
    participant 'alpha', :activity => 'send refusal note', :if => '${f:decision} == refused'
  end
</pre>

But this is not strictly equivalent

With a bit of imagination, exclusive choices may be found beyond ifs :

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  Ruote.process_definition :name => 'request processing' do

    sequence do
      # ... 
      participant :ref => 'editor' # decision : accepted or refused
      subprocess :ref => 'request_${f:decision}'
      # ...
    end

    define 'request_accepted' do
      participant :ref => 'alpha', :activity => 'request further info'
    end

    define 'request_refused' do
      participant :ref => 'alpha', :activity => 'send refusal note'
    end
  end
</pre>

The name of the "subprocess":exp/subprocess.html is extrapolated at runtime and the flow is routed accordingly.

"original pattern explanation":http://workflowpatterns.com/patterns/control/basic/wcp4.php | "top":#top

<!-- H3 -->

h3(#ba_simple_merge). simple merge

A simple merge occur when two (or more) exclusive branch converge. As seen in "exclusive choice":#ba_exclusive_choice this pattern is implicitely supported. It simply occurs when the 'then' or the 'else' clause of an 'if' terminates and the flow resumes.

"original pattern explanation":http://workflowpatterns.com/patterns/control/basic/wcp5.php | "top":#top

<hr/>

h2(#advanced). Advanced Branching and Synchronization Patterns

<!-- H3 -->

h3(#ad_multi_choice). multi choice

Combining the "concurrence":exp/concurrence.html expression and :if attributes makes for an easy implementation of this pattern :

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  concurrence do
    participant 'regular service', :if => '${f:price} < 50'
    participant 'premium service', :if => '${f:price} > 40'
    participant 'extra service', :if => '${f:extra_ordered}'
  end
</pre>

In this example, if the price is between 40 and 50, regular service and premium service are triggered, extra could be triggerd as well if the field 'extra_ordered' has the value 'true'.

"original pattern explanation":http://workflowpatterns.com/patterns/control/advanced_branching/wcp6.php | "top":#top

<!-- H3 -->

h3(#ad_structured_synchronizing_merge). structured synchronizing merge

The "multi choice":#ad_multi_choice pattern implementation implicitely support this 'structured synchronizing merge'. The "concurrence":exp/concurrence.html expression waits for all its children expression to reply before resuming the flow.

"original pattern explanation":http://workflowpatterns.com/patterns/control/advanced_branching/wcp7.php | "top":#top

<!-- H3 -->

h3(#ad_multi_merge). multi merge

<em>The convergence of two or more branches into a single subsequent branch such that each enablement of an incoming branch results in the thread of control being passed to the subsequent branch.</em>

The flash animation for this pattern is worth a "look":http://workflowpatterns.com/patterns/control/advanced_branching/wcp8_animation.php.

Basically, what comes after the multi-merge will be executed once for each incoming replies.

Certainly, ruote doesn't support that out of the box, but there are approximations to it :

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  Ruote.process_definition :name => 'multi merge' do

    concurrence do
      sequence do
        team_a
        after
      end
      sequence do
        team_b
        after
      end
      sequence :if => '${f:more_capacity_needed}' do
        extra_team
        after
      end
    end

    define 'after' do
      participant 'supervisor', :activity => 'assess work'
    end
  end
</pre>

Here, a subprocess ("define":exp/define.html 'after') is used after each concurrent branch. Before replying to its parent (the concurrence), each branch calls it. (team_a, team_b and extra_team could be participant or subprocess names).

Leveraging the "listen":exp/listen.html expression is another option :

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  Ruote.process_definition :name => 'multi merge' do

    concurrence :count => 3, :remaining => :forget do

      team_a
      team_b
      team_extra :if => '${f:more_capacity_needed}'

      listen :to => /^team\_.+/, :upon => :reply do
        participant 'supervisor', :activity => 'assess work'
      end
    end
  end
</pre>

With this process definition, each time a team participant replies, the participant 'supervisor' is sent a workitem. Please note that this works only with participants. In the above subprocess example, 'team_a' could point either to a participant, either to a subprocess.

"original pattern explanation":http://workflowpatterns.com/patterns/control/advanced_branching/wcp8.php | "top":#top

<!-- H3 -->

h3(#ad_structured_discriminator). structured discriminator

As soon as one of two concurrent branches replies, the flow resumes and the other branch is 'forgotten' (continues its execution without the parent process caring for its outcome).

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  sequence do
    concurrence :count => 1, :remaining => :forget do
      test_batch_a
      test_batch_b
    end
    final_test_batch
  end
</pre>

As soon as an initial test batch is completed, the final test batch is triggered. The remaining test batch continues, unhindered (but forgotten).

The attributes :count and :remaining of the "concurrence":exp/concurrence.html are used. Note that those attributes are understood by the "concurrent_iterator":exp/concurrent_iterator.html expression as well :

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  sequence do
    concurrent_iterator :on => 'a, b, c, d', :count => 1, :remaining => :forget do
      subprocess :ref => 'test_batch_${v:i}'
        # batches a, b, c and d will get triggered
    end
    final_test_batch
  end
</pre>

h2(#structural). Structural Patterns

<!-- H3 -->

h3(#st_arbitrary_cycles). arbitrary cycles

<em>The ability to represent cycles in a process model that have more than one entry or exit point.</em>

Thanks to the "cursor":exp/cursor.html expression, the process represented as "flash animation":http://workflowpatterns.com/patterns/control/structural/wcp10_animation.php on the Workflow Patterns site may be implemented as :

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  cursor do
    participant 'a'
    participant 'b'
    participant 'c'
    jump :to => 'b', :if => '${f:back_to_b}'
    participant 'd'
    jump :to => 'c', :if => '${f:back_to_c}'
    participant 'e'
  end
</pre>

The "jump":exp/command.html expression understand participant names, subprocess names and :tag names in its :to attribute, making it easy to specify jump points.

"original pattern explanation":http://workflowpatterns.com/patterns/control/structural/wcp10.php | "top":#top

<!-- H3 -->

h3(#st_implicit_termination). implicit termination

Replicating the "flash animation of the pattern":http://workflowpatterns.com/patterns/control/structural/wcp11_animation.php, we obtain :

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  sequence do
    participant 'alpha'
    concurrence do
      sequence do
        participant 'bravo'
        participant 'delta'
      end
      sequence do
        participant 'charly'
        participant 'echo'
      end
    end
  end
</pre>

There is not much to say about this pattern. When there is no more work, the process ends.

"original pattern explanation":http://workflowpatterns.com/patterns/control/structural/wcp11.php | "top":#top

h2(#multiple). Multiple Instance Patterns

<!-- H3 -->

h3(#mu_multiple_instances_without_synchronization). multiple instances without synchronization

<em>within a given process instance, multiple instances of an activity can be created. These instances are independent of each other and run concurrently. There is no requirement to synchronize them upon completion.</em>

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  concurrent_iterator :times => 10 do
    activity :forget => true
  end
</pre>

'activity' here could be a participant or a subprocess named 'activity'. :forget is set to true (no requirement to synchronize). The process will resume immediately after this "concurrent_iterator":exp/concurrent_iterator.html (since all its children are forgotten).

The "flash animation":http://workflowpatterns.com/patterns/control/multiple_instance/wcp12_animation.php could be translated to something like :

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  sequence do
    participant 'a'
    concurrent_iterator :times => '${f:count}' do
      participant 'b', :forget => true
    end
    participant 'c'
  end
</pre>

The number of 'b' instances to fire is expected to be found in the workitem field named 'count' (value is perhaps chosen by participant 'a').

"original pattern explanation":http://workflowpatterns.com/patterns/control/multiple_instance/wcp12.php | "top":#top

<!-- H3 -->

h3(#mu_multiple_instances_with_a_priori_design_time_knowledge). multiple instances with a priori design time knowledge

<em>the required number of instances is known at design time. These instances are independent of each other and run concurrently. It is necessary to synchronize the activity instances at completion before any subsequent activities can be triggered.</em>

The "concurrence":exp/concurrence.html or the "concurrent_iterator":exp/concurrent_iterator.html expressions can be used.

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  concurrence do
    participant 'alfred'
    participant 'bertha'
    participant 'charly'
  end
</pre>

which can be rewritten as :

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  concurrent_iterator :on => 'alfred, bertha, charly', :to_field => 'p' do
    participant :ref => '${f:p}'
  end
</pre>

"original pattern explanation":http://workflowpatterns.com/patterns/control/multiple_instance/wcp13.php | "top":#top

<!-- H3 -->

h3(#mu_multiple_instances_with_a_priori_run_time_knowledge). multiple instances with a priori run time knowledge

<em>Within a given process instance, multiple instances of an activity can be created. The required number of instances may depend on a number of runtime factors, including state data, resource availability and inter-process communications, but is known before the activity instances must be created. Once initiated, these instances are independent of each other and run concurrently. It is necessary to synchronize the instances at completion before any subsequent activities can be triggered.</em>

It's again a job for the "concurrent_iterator":exp/concurrent_iterator.html expression.

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  concurrent_iterator :on => '${f:reviewer_list}', :to_field => 'p' do
    participant :ref => '${f:p}'
  end
</pre>

Here, the list of participant that will 'perform' concurrently is help in a workitem field named 'reviewer_list' (a comma-separated list of participant names).

"original pattern explanation":http://workflowpatterns.com/patterns/control/multiple_instance/wcp14.php | "top":#top

<!-- H3 -->

h3(#mu_multiple_instances_without_a_priori_run_time_knowledge). multiple instances without a priori run time knowledge

The number of activity is known at runtime and may change at any point during the execution of these activities.

The expression "add_branches":exp/add_branches.html which works in conjunction with the "concurrent_iterator":exp/concurrent_iterator.html expression is necessary for this pattern implementation.

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  concurrence :count => 1 do

    concurrent_iterator :on => '${f:reviewer_list}', :tag => 'review' do
      participant :ref => '${v:i}'
    end

    repeat do
      participant 'supervisor', :q => 'add more reviewers ?'
      add_branches '${f:new_supervisors}', :ref => 'review'
    end
  end
</pre>

The review work is performed in the concurrent_iterator tagged 'review'. Concurrently a participant supervisor is asked if more reviewers are needed. He has the opportunity to add more reviewers as long as the concurrent_iterator is not over. Since the wrapping concurrence has a :count of 1, as soon as the iterator is done, the concurrence will be over (the supervisor branch getting cancelled).

The add_branches expression knows it has to add the supervisor to the concurrent iterator via the :ref => 'review' declaration.

"original pattern explanation":http://workflowpatterns.com/patterns/control/multiple_instance/wcp15.php | "top":#top

h2(#state). State-based Patterns

<!-- H3 -->

h3(#sa_deferred_choice). deferred choice

This pattern is difficult for ruote to implement. It requires some control over the state of the workitem as a task, and since ruote delegates task handling to participants...

A set of participants is presented with a task, as soon as one of them starts working on it, the other instances of the task are withdrawn from the other participants.

With a bit of help from the participant implementations, this could be a realization :

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  sequence do

    # presenting the task

    concurrence :count => 1 do
      participant 'a', :task => 'start work'
      participant 'b', :task => 'start work'
    end

    # performing the task

    participant '${a_or_b}', :task => 'perform work'
  end
</pre>

As soon as 'a' or 'b' replies ("concurrence":exp/concurrence.html :count => 1), it is presented with the task again. The other participant receives a cancel notification.

Of course, the workitem/task presented is not strictly equivalent to the task to be performed...

Perhaps the better way to implement this pattern is within the participant itself. The ruote engine could dispatch the task to participant 'x', a worklist handler managing access rights, escalation and so and so independently.
