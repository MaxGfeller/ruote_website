h2. "noisy" mode

When testing/debugging a workflow, the NOISY mode might come in handy. This mode prints all the messages happening _locally_ (sorry if you have more than one workers, there'll be one different output per worker).

To switch it on, one has to set _noisy_ to true in the Ruote::Dashboard, like in line 8 below.

Let's consider this small ruote test script:

<pre class="brush: ruby">
require 'pp'
require 'rufus-json/automatic'
require 'ruote'


ruote = Ruote::Dashboard.new(Ruote::Worker.new(Ruote::HashStorage.new))

ruote.noisy = ENV['NOISY'] == 'true'

ruote.register do
  alpha Ruote::StorageParticipant
end

pdef =
  Ruote.define do
    concurrence :count => 1 do
      cursor :tag => 'C1' do
        alpha :timeout => '10s'
      end
      cursor :tag => 'C2', :lose => true do
        wait '2s' # simulating 'bravo' replying before alpha
        jump :to => 'alpha', :ref => 'C1'
      end
    end
  end

wfid = ruote.launch(pdef)

ruote.wait_for(wfid)
</pre>

(gist at "https://gist.github.com/4332547":https://gist.github.com/4332547)

Running it with:

<pre class="brush: shell">
NOISY=true bundle exec ruby gist4332547.rb
</pre>

Will output:

<a href="/images/noisy_0.png"><img src="/images/noisy_0.png" width="664px" /></a>

Roughly, each line is a "msg", an event just processed by the local worker. Let's look at a single line:

<a href="/images/noisy_1.png"><img
  id="line2"
  src="/images/noisy_1.png"
  style="width: 664px"
/></a>

Which can be split into

<img src="/images/noisy_1c.png" />

The first block is mostly about when the msg got processed. The first number is just a counter modulo 10 for pointing at msgs more easily. The last number, right after the timestamp, is the last part of the worker instance object_id, it can be useful when debugging environments with multiple ruote workers (interleaved tests for example).

The second block is composed of the action code and a star. The star is just here to separate the code from the expression identifier (fei) that follows. This action code is a short version of the msg action [name]. See below for a "list of action codes":#action_codes and their corresponding action names.
