h2. lists

The main list is the users' mailing list : "http://groups.google.com/group/openwferu-users":http://groups.google.com/group/openwferu-users

The users mailing list is the preferred support medium (since it's archived), but there is also the #ruote channel on freenode.net which is used from time to time.
