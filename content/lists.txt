h2. lists

The ruote mailing list is at : "http://groups.google.com/group/openwferu-users":http://groups.google.com/group/openwferu-users

(it still bears the old name 'openwferu', but don't worry, it's the right place)

The users mailing list is the preferred support medium, but there is also the #ruote channel on freenode.net ("archived":http://ruote-irclogs.s3.amazonaws.com/logs.html as well).
