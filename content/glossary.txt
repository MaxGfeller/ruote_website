h2. glossary

An attempt at defining or explaining terms in ruote and about workflow engines in general.


h3(#engine). engine

Before ruote 2.x, an engine was a monolithic worker + storage system. It made sense to call it an engine. With ruote 2.x, the engine became a mere "dashboard", but the name stuck.

Looking a the initialization of an engine clearly shows the separation

<pre class="brush: ruby">
engine = Ruote::Engine.new(Ruote::Worker.new(Ruote::HashStorage.new))
</pre>

The engine is not necessarily containing a worker. The worker can be run independently, with the engine instantied only for launching/querying purposes (the workflow enactment work being performed in the workers).

<pre class="brush: ruby">
worker = Ruote::Worker.new(Ruote::HashStorage.new)

engine = Ruote::Engine.new(Ruote::HashStorage.new)
</pre>


h3(#flow_expression). flow expression

A piece of a process instance.


h3(#fei). fei, flow expression id

An identifier for a flow expression. This same identifier is used to identify "workitems":#workitem


h3(#receiver). receiver

A piece of code that listens/polls on a given channel (queue, mail inbox, directory, ...) for incoming workitems (or launch orders) and then pass them to ruote (by placing a msg in the storage).


h3(#participant). participant

A participant takes part in a process instance. "Participants":participants.html are registered in the engine. A participant may take part in multiple process instances and especially instances of various process definitions.

For example the participant "Al" may take part in instances of the "enter and filter new motherboards" and the "perform test batches" processes.


h3(#process). process

Depending on the context, this word can be used for process definition or for process instance.


h3(#process_definition). process definition

A template for a process. "Process definitions":http://ruote.rubyforge.org/definitions.html are the result of process modelling.


h3(#process_instance). process instance

A process definition, turned into an instance for execution. Is uniquely (in a ruote system) by a "wfid":#wfid (workflow instance id).


h3(#storage). storage

Where the ruote data is persisted.

There are multiple storage implementations. See "configuration":configuration.html#storage for more info.


h3(#wfid). wfid, workflow instance id

Could have been renamed "process instance id", but the "pid" abbrevation is already "heavily used":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_identifier.


h3(#worker). worker

A work performer. Handles messages transiting via the "storage":#storage, execute the action requested in them.

Those actions include "apply" (creating and applying a new flow expression), "reply" (replying to a [parent] flow expression), "cancel" (cancelling a flow expression, or a whole process instance), ...


h3(#workitem). workitem

A token of execution in a process instance. They are usually visible when handed to participants.
