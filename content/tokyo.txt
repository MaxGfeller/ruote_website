h2. Tokyo Cabinet / Tyrant install

"Tokyo Cabinet / Tyrant":http://tokyocabinet.sf.net/index.html are two nifty pieces of software. The simplest way of getting the latest of and best version of time is by downloading the source and compiling it.

MacPorts come with an older version of Tokyo Cabinet and no copy of Tokyo Tyrant (well, at least the MacPorts on my mac). Since compiling is very easy (and fast). I tend to "go from the source":http://tokyocabinet.sourceforge.net/spex-en.html#installation instead of using a binary package. My debian box apt-get doesn't seem to know anything about Tyrant or Cabinet.

(Note for Mac users, the compiling step requires the installation of XCode, it's on the install CD/DVD that comes with the Mac).

Tokyo Tyrant depends on Tokyo Cabinet. Compile and install Cabinet first.

If you don't need Tokyo Tyrant (no remote access needed), feel free to just install Tokyo Cabinet.


h3. getting the source 

h4. via sourceforge.net

- "Tokyo Cabinet":http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=200242&package_id=237686
- "Tokyo Tyrant":http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=200242&package_id=260026

<pre>
tar xzvf tokyocabinet-1.4.5.tar.gz
tar xzvf tokyotyrant-1.1.14.tar.gz
</pre>

(version numbers will probably change)


h4. via github.com

If you have "git" installed on your system, you can directly fetch the Tokyo sources, thanks to "Etrepum":http://github.com/etrepum

<pre>
git clone git://github.com/etrepum/tokyo-cabinet.git
git clone git://github.com/etrepum/tokyo-tyrant.git
</pre>


h3. compiling and installing

<pre>
cd tokyo-cabinet/
./configure
make
sudo make install
</pre>

and

<pre>
cd tokyo-tyrant/
./configure
make
sudo make install
</pre>

Once install is done, the Cabinet "tools":http://tokyocabinet.sourceforge.net/spex-en.html#tcadbapi_cli and the Tyrant "server":http://tokyocabinet.sourceforge.net/tyrantdoc/#serverprog and "tools":http://tokyocabinet.sourceforge.net/tyrantdoc/#clientprog will be present on your system.


h3. uninstalling

If you don't need Tokyo Cabinet or Tyrant, it's easy to come back in the build directory and to run "sudo make uninstall".

<pre>
cd tokyo-tyrant/
sudo make uninstall
</pre>

When upgrading to a newer version of either Tokyo Cabinet or Tokyo Tyrant, this "sudo make uninstall" comes handy as well.
