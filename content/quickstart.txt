h3. quickstart

Here is a tiny process that fetches picture info from "http://flickr.com":http://flickr.com and submit it to three user, working concurrently on choosing their favourite photo.

Three human participants and two automated participants are involved (though for the sake of brevity, our human participants are represented by a random number generator)

This example is inspired by Amazon's mechanical turk, where one example of workflow uses human participants to tell whether a set of pictures contains the photo of a tree or an animal, etc...

To run this example, you have at first to install the ruote gem (and the atom-tools one) :

<pre>
sudo gem install ruote atom-tools
</pre>

Then, to download and run the quickstart (Ruby 1.8.6 at least) :

<pre>
curl http://gist.github.com/raw/35914/d7bf829870c1a24eac7ac78be41d71535f8c8f48 > qs.rb
ruby qs.rb
</pre>

That should generate an output like :

<pre>
 users selected those images : 

 - user-charly :: http://www.flickr.com/photos/ssami/3105506108/
 - user-bob :: http://www.flickr.com/photos/30211958@N00/3106452587/
 - user-alice :: http://www.flickr.com/photos/mynamemeanseyes/3098673543/
</pre>

If not, you'll find some help on the "user's mailing list":http://groups.google.com/group/openwferu-users or on the #ruote channel on freenode.net

Here is the source of the quickstart :

(I initially planned to use another quickstart example, but was not really happy with it, it's "visible":http://jmettraux.wordpress.com/2008/12/15/mini-todo-tool/ anyway)
