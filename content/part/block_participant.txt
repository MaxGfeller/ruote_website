h2. block_participant


One of the simplest participants. Simply passes a workitem to a block
of ruby code.

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  engine.register_participant :alpha do |workitem|
    workitem.fields['time'] = Time.now
  end
</pre>

This participant implicitely replies to the engine when the block execution
is over.

You can pass the flow_expression (participant expression) as well.

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  engine.register_participant :alpha do |workitem, flow_exp|
    workitem.fields['amount'] = flow_exp.lookup_variable('amount')
  end

</pre>

h3. do_not_thread

By default, this participant (like most other participants) is executed
in its own thread.
