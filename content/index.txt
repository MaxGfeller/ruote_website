h3. description

<strong>Ruote</strong> is a workflow engine written in Ruby.  It's a runtime for long running [business] processes.

Ruote is available under the new "BSD":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses#Proprietary_software_licenses_compatibility open source license.

There is a small "quickstart":quickstart.html available, it focuses on the ruote 'gem'. For an example integration in Rails there is an online "demo":http://difference.openwfe.org:3000 (though it's still running an old version)

Processes are explicitely defined and may be explicitely handled (start, pause, cancel, update).

A process is started by handing a [business] process definition to the engine.  A <strong>process definition</strong> is expressed in ruote's own process definition language, which comes in two flavours : XML and a Ruby DSL.

A process definition will describe the flow of work among <strong>participants</strong>.

A ruote engine can handle simultaneously multiple <strong>process instances</strong>, created from one or more different process definitions. A process instance can be modified on the fly.
