h2. concurrence


The 'concurrence' expression applies its child branches in parallel
(well it makes a best effort to make them run in parallel).

<% coderay(:lang => 'ruby', :line_numbers => 'inline') do -%>
  concurrence do
    alpha
    bravo
  end
<% end %>

h3. attributes

The concurrence expression takes a number of attributes that allow for
sophisticated control (especially at merge time).

h4. :count

<% coderay(:lang => 'ruby', :line_numbers => 'inline') do -%>
  concurrence :count => 1 do
    alpha
    bravo
  end
<% end %>

in that example, the concurrence will terminate as soon as 1 (count) of
the branches replies. The other branch will get cancelled.

h4. :remaining

As said for :count, the remaining branches get cancelled. By setting
:remaining to :forget (or 'forget'), the remaining branches will continue
their execution, forgotten.

<% coderay(:lang => 'ruby', :line_numbers => 'inline') do -%>
  concurrence :count => 1, :remaining => :forget do
    alpha
    bravo
  end
<% end %>

h4. :merge

By default, the workitems override each others. By default, the first
workitem to reply will win.

<% coderay(:lang => 'ruby', :line_numbers => 'inline') do -%>
  sequence do
    concurrence do
      alpha
      bravo
    end
    charly
  end
<% end %>

In that example, if 'alpha' replied first, the workitem that reaches
'charly' once 'bravo' replied will have the payload as seen/modified by
'alpha'.

The :merge attribute determines which branch wins the merge.

* first (default)
* last
* highest
* lowest

highest and lowest refer to the position in the list of branch. It's useful
to set a fixed winner.

<% coderay(:lang => 'ruby', :line_numbers => 'inline') do -%>
  concurrence :merge => :highest do
    alpha
    bravo
  end
<% end %>

makes sure that alpha's version of the workitem wins.

h4. :merge_type

By default, the merge type is set to 'override', which means that the
'winning' workitem's payload supplants all other workitems' payloads.

Setting :merge_type to :mix, will actually attempt to merge field by field,
making sure that the field value of the winner(s) are used.

:isolate will rearrange the resulting workitem payload so that there is
a new field for each branch. The name of each field is the index of the
branch from '0' to ...

:stack will stack the workitems coming back from the concurrence branches
in an array whose order is determined by the :merge attributes. The array
is placed in the 'stack' field of the resulting workitem.
Note that the :stack merge_type also creates a 'stack_attributes' field
and populates it with the expanded attributes of the concurrence.

Thus

<% coderay(:lang => 'ruby', :line_numbers => 'inline') do -%>
  sequence do
    concurrence :merge => :highest, :merge_type => :stack do
      reviewer1
      reviewer2
    end
    editor
  end
<% end %>

will see the 'editor' receive a workitem whose fields look like :

<% coderay(:lang => 'ruby', :line_numbers => 'inline') do -%>
  { 'stack' => [{ ... reviewer1 fields ... }, { ... reviewer2 fields ... }],
    'stack_attributes' => { 'merge'=> 'highest', 'merge_type' => 'stack' } }
<% end %>

This could prove useful for participant having to deal with multiple merge
strategy results.


h4. :over_if (and :over_unless)

Like the :count attribute controls how many branches have to reply before
a concurrence ends, the :over attribute is used to specify a condition
upon which the concurrence will [prematurely] end.

<% coderay(:lang => 'ruby', :line_numbers => 'inline') do -%>
  concurrence :over_if => '${f:over}'
    alpha
    bravo
    charly
  end
<% end %>

will end the concurrence as soon as one of the branches replies with a
workitem whose field 'over' is set to true. (the remaining branches will
get cancelled unless :remaining => :forget is set).

:over_unless needs no explanation.
