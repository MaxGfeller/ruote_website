h2. reserve


Prevents two process branches from executing at the same time.

<% coderay(:lang => 'ruby', :line_numbers => 'inline') do -%>
  pdef = Ruote.process_definition :name => 'test' do
    concurrence do
      reserve :mutex => 'a' do
        alpha
      end
      reserve 'a' do
        alpha
      end
    end
  end
<% end %>

(Nice and tiny example, turns a concurrence into a sequence...)
