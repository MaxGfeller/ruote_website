h2. error


This error is used by the 'error' expression, when an error is triggered
from the process definition.


Triggers an error directly from the process definition.

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  Ruote.process_definition :name => 'log1' do
    sequence do
      perform_inventory
      error 'inventory issue', :if => '${f:level} < 1'
      order_new_stuff
      store_new_stuff
    end
  end
</pre>

Replaying the error will 'unlock' the process.
