h2. concurrent_iterator


This expression is a cross between 'concurrence' and 'iterator'.

<% coderay(:lang => 'ruby', :line_numbers => 'inline') do -%>
  pdef = Ruote.process_definition :name => 'test' do
    concurrent_iterator :on_val => 'alice, bob, charly', :to_var => 'v' do
      participant '${v:v}'
    end
  end
<% end %>

will be equivalent to

<% coderay(:lang => 'ruby', :line_numbers => 'inline') do -%>
  pdef = Ruote.process_definition :name => 'test' do
    concurrence do
      participant 'alice'
      participant 'bob'
      participant 'charly'
    end
  end
<% end %>

The 'on' and the 'to' attributes follow exactly the ones for the iterator
expression.

When there is no 'to', the current iterated value is placed in the variable
named 'i'.

The variable named 'ii' contains the current iterated index (an int bigger
or egal to 0).

'concurrent_iterator' does not understand commands like
rewind/break/jump/... like 'iterator' does, since it fires all its
branches when applied.

h3. :times and :branches

Similarly to the iterator expression, the :times or the :branches attribute
may be used in stead of the 'on' attribute.

<% coderay(:lang => 'ruby', :line_numbers => 'inline') do -%>
  pdef = Ruote.process_definition :name => 'test' do
    concurrent_iterator :times => 3
      participant 'user${v:i}'
    end
  end
<% end %>

is equivalent to

<% coderay(:lang => 'ruby', :line_numbers => 'inline') do -%>
  pdef = Ruote.process_definition :name => 'test' do
    concurrence do
      participant 'user0'
      participant 'user1'
      participant 'user2'
    end
  end

<% end %>

h3. options

the concurrent_iterator accepts the same options for merging as its bigger
brother, the concurrence expression.

:count, :merge (override, mix, isolate), remaining (cancel, forget) and
:over.


h3. add branches

The 'add_branches'/'add_branch' expression can be used to add branches
to a concurrent-iterator while it is running.

<% coderay(:lang => 'ruby', :line_numbers => 'inline') do -%>
  concurrent_iterator :on => 'a, b, c' do
    sequence do
      participant :ref => 'worker_${v:i}'
      add_branches 'd, e', :if => '${v:/not_sufficient}'
    end
  end
<% end %>

In this example, if the process level variable 'not_sufficient' is set to
true, workers d and e will be added to the iterated elements.
