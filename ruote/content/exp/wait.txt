h2. wait


Waits (sleeps) for a given period of time before resuming the flow.

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  sequence do
    accounting :task => 'invoice'
    wait '30d' # 30 days
    accounting :task => 'check if customer paid'
  end
</pre>

'_sleep' is also OK

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  _sleep '7d10h' # 7 days and 10 hours
</pre>

(the underscore prevents collision with Ruby's sleep method)

h3. :for and :until

'wait' accepts as well :

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  wait :for => '30d' # wait for 30 days
  wait :until => '2011/12/10 12:00:00' # any parseable date/time format
<% end %>
