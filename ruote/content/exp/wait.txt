h2. wait


Waits (sleeps) for a given period of time before resuming the flow.

<% coderay(:lang => 'ruby', :line_numbers => 'inline') do -%>
  sequence do
    accounting :task => 'invoice'
    wait '30d' # 30 days
    accounting :task => 'check if customer paid'
  end
<% end %>

'_sleep' is also OK

<% coderay(:lang => 'ruby', :line_numbers => 'inline') do -%>
  _sleep '7d10h' # 7 days and 10 hours
<% end %>

(the underscore prevents collision with Ruby's sleep method)

h3. :for and :until
