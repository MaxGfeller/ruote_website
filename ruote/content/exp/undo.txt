h2. undo


Undoes (cancels) another expression referred by its tag.

<% coderay(:lang => 'ruby', :line_numbers => 'inline') do -%>
  pdef = Ruote.process_definition do
    concurrence do
      alpha :tag => 'kilroy'
      undo :ref => 'kilroy'
    end
  end
<% end %>

This example is rather tiny, but it shows a process branch (undo) cancelling
another (alpha).
