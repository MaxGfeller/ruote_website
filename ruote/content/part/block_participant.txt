h2. block_participant


One of the simplest participants. Simply passes a workitem to a block
of ruby code.

<% coderay(:lang => 'ruby', :line_numbers => 'inline') do -%>
  engine.register_participant :alpha do |workitem|
    workitem.fields['time'] = Time.now
  end
<% end %>

This participant implicitely replies to the engine when the block execution
is over.

You can pass the flow_expression (participant expression) as well.

<% coderay(:lang => 'ruby', :line_numbers => 'inline') do -%>
  engine.register_participant :alpha do |workitem, flow_exp|
    workitem.fields['amount'] = flow_exp.lookup_variable('amount')
  end

<% end %>

h3. do_not_thead

By default, this participant (like most other participants) is executed
in its own thread (in a Ruby runtime where EventMachine is running,
EM.next_tick is used instead of a new thread).

You can change that behaviour (beware block thats monopolises the whole
engine !) by doing

<% coderay(:lang => 'ruby', :line_numbers => 'inline') do -%>
  alpha = engine.register_participant :alpha do |workitem|
    workitem.fields['time'] = Time.now
  end

  alpha.do_not_thread = true
<% end %>

(you could also override do_not_thread, the method ...)
