h2. smtp_participant


A very stupid SMTP participant.

h3. options

* :server - the IP address or hostname of the SMTP server/gateway (defaults to '127.0.0.1')
* :port - the port of the SMTP server/gateway (defaults to 25)
* :from - the from mail address (mandatory)
* :to - the to mail address[es]
* :template - a String template for the mail message
* :notification - when set to true, the flow will resume immediately after having sent the email


h3. :template

<% coderay(:lang => 'ruby', :line_numbers => 'inline') do -%>
  @engine.register_participant(
    :no_good_notification,
    Ruote::SmtpParticipant,
    :server => 'smtp.example.com'
    :port => 25,
    :to => 'toto@example.com',
    :from => 'john@example.com',
    :notification => true,
    :template => "Subject: ${f:email_subject}\n\nno good.")
<% end %>

Process variable / workitem field substitution works the same as in
process definitions (in this example, the workitem field email_subject will
be used as the subject of the email...)


h3. :to or workitem.fields['email_target']

The target of the email is either given via the workitem field
'email_target', either by the option :to. The workitem field takes
precedence if both are present.

This parameter/option may be either a single (string) email address, either
an array of (string) email addresses.


h3. final note : mail listener

This participant cannot read POP/IMAP accounts for you. You have to
use a mail listener or get a web reply by placing a link in the message...
