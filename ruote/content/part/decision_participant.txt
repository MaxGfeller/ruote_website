h2. decision_participant


Decision participants were named 'CSV participants' prior to ruote 2.1.

Make sure you have the gem "rufus-decision" installed in order to
use this decision participant.


h3. blog post

This Rufus::Decision::Participant was introduced in the "ruote and
decision tables" blog post :

h3. example

In this example, a participant named 'decide_team_member' is bound in the
ruote engine and, depending on the value of the workitem fields 'topic'
and region, sets the value of the field named 'team_member' :

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  require 'rufus/decision/participant'

  engine.register_participant(
    :decide_team_member
    Rufus::Decision::Participant, :table => %{
      in:topic,in:region,out:team_member
      sports,europe,Alice
      sports,,Bob
      finance,america,Charly
      finance,europe,Donald
      finance,,Ernest
      politics,asia,Fujio
      politics,america,Gilbert
      politics,,Henry
      ,,Zach
    })

  pdef = Ruote.process_definition :name => 'dec-test', :revision => '1' do
    sequence do
      decide_team_member
      participant :ref => '${team_member}'
    end
  end
</pre>

A process instance about the election results in Venezuela :

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  engine.launch(
    pdef,
    'topic' => 'politics',
    'region' => 'america',
    'line' => 'election results in Venezuela')
</pre>

would thus get routed to Gilbert.

h3. pointing to a table via a URI

Note that you can reference the table by its URI :

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  engine.register_participant(
    :decide_team_member
    Rufus::Decision::Participant,
    :table => 'http://decisions.example.com/journalists.csv')
</pre>

If the table were a Google Spreadsheet, it would look like (note the
trailing &output=csv) :

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  engine.register_participant(
    :decide_team_member
    Rufus::Decision::Participant,
    :table => 'http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pCZNVR1TQ&output=csv')
<% end %>
