h2. ruote 2.0 quickstart

Ruote 2.0 is mainly tested with Ruby 1.9.1 but seems to run fine with Ruby 1.8.7.

This quickstart aims at showing a minimal process instance run. It's a limited example.


h3. getting ruote 2.0

Provided that you have a recent version of "git":http://progit.org/book/ch1-4.html, you can do from your command line :

<pre>
git clone git://github.com/jmettraux/ruote.git
cd ruote
rake deps:install
</pre>

Tracking the ruote2.0 is currently required. We will however turn this branch into the master branch soon.

The rake call will install the gems that ruote 2.0 requires for proper operation.


h3. first run

This piece of code passes a workitem from participant Alpha to participant Bravo :

<% coderay(:lang => 'ruby', :line_numbers => 'inline') do -%>
$:.unshift('lib') # running from ruote/ probably

require 'rubygems'
require 'ruote/engine'

# preparing the engine

engine = Ruote::FsPersistedEngine.new

# registering participants

engine.register_participant :alpha do |workitem|
  workitem.fields['message'] = { 'text' => 'hello !', 'author' => 'Alice' }
end

engine.register_participant :bravo do |workitem|
  puts "I received a message from #{workitem.fields['message']['author']}"
end

# defining a process

pdef = Ruote.process_definition :name => 'test' do
  sequence do
    participant :alpha
    participant :bravo
  end
end

# launching, creating a process instance

pid = engine.launch(pdef)

sleep 1

# => 'I received a message from Alice'
<% end %>

This quickstart can be found in examples/ruote_quickstart.rb

Run it with :

<pre>
ruby examples/ruote_quickstart.rb
</pre>

It will exit after 1 second, having run 1 process instance.
