h2. lists

The ruote mailing list is at : "http://groups.google.com/group/openwferu-users":http://groups.google.com/group/openwferu-users

(it still bears the old name 'openwferu', but don't worry, it's the right place)

The users mailing list is the preferred support medium (since it's archived), but there is also the #ruote channel on freenode.net which is used from time to time.
