h2. attributes common to all expressions

The attributes listed on this page may be used with any expression.

* ":timeout":#timeout
* ":if or :unless":#if_unless
* ":forget":#forget
* ":on_error":#on_error
* ":on_cancel":#on_cancel
* ":on_timeout":#on_timeout


h3(#timeout). :timeout

If after two days, the two reviewers couldn't do their work, the process instance will resume to the editor :

<% coderay(:lang => 'ruby', :line_numbers => 'inline') do -%>
  sequence do
    participant :ref => 'author'
    sequence :timeout => '2d' do
      participant :ref => 'reviewer1'
      participant :ref => 'reviewer2'
    end
    participant :ref => 'editor'
  end
<% end %>

:timeout understands h, m, d, s (respectively hour, minute, day, second). It also understands y, M, w (for year, Month and week), but they are rarely used.

It's OK to give an absolute date to the :timeout attribute :

<% coderay(:lang => 'ruby', :line_numbers => 'inline') do -%>
  participant :ref => 'author', :timeout => 'Sun Jan 24 17:28:28 +0900 2010'
<% end %>

But most of the time absolute dates are fetched from process variables or workitem fields :

<% coderay(:lang => 'ruby', :line_numbers => 'inline') do -%>
  participant :ref => 'author', :timeout => '${f:time_limit}'
<% end %>

Please note that "participants":exp/participant.html may have their say in their timeout.

You might also have a look at the ":on_timeout":#on_timeout attribute.


h3(#if_unless). :if / :unless

These two attributes accept a condition string. If the condition evaluates to true (or false for :unless), the expression will get executed, else not.

The CEO will receive a workitem / task only if the budget (stored in a workitem field) exceeds 23000 :

<% coderay(:lang => 'ruby', :line_numbers => 'inline') do -%>
  concurrence do
    participant 'ceo', :if => '${f:budget} > 23000'
    participant 'cfo'
    participant '${f:bu_head}'
  end
<% end %>

Any expression may use :if / :unless :

<% coderay(:lang => 'ruby', :line_numbers => 'inline') do -%>
  cursor do
    subprocess 'gather_data'
    subprocess 'generate_graphs'
    participant 'quality_control'
    rewind :unless => '${f:sufficient_data}'
    subprocess 'generate_pdfs'
    # over
  end
<% end %>

Really any :

<% coderay(:lang => 'ruby', :line_numbers => 'inline') do -%>
  sequence do
    sequence :if => '${f:weather} == rainy' do
      rent_tent
      rent_heating_system
    end
    concurrence do
      sequence do
        emit_invitations
        gather_responses :timeout => '3w'
      end
      cursor :if => '${f:orchestra}' do
        gather_orchestra
        decide_about_orchestra
        reserve_orchestra
        rewind :if => '${f:orchestra_already_taken}'
      end
      participant 'mayor', :task => 'notification'
    end
  end
<% end %>


h3(#forget). :forget

An expression flagged with :forget => true or :forget => 'true' gets forgotten, it is considered has having replied immediately to its parent expression, though its 'execution' is resuming independently.

<% coderay(:lang => 'ruby', :line_numbers => 'inline') do -%>
  concurrence do
    participant 'alfred'
    participant 'bob'
    participant 'charly', :forget => true
  end
<% end %>

Charly will receive a workitem, but the concurrence will receive a reply immediately, thus, the concurrence (and the rest of the process) will resume as soon as both Alfred and Bob have replied.

It can be used for some kind of rough fire and forget concurrency :

<% coderay(:lang => 'ruby', :line_numbers => 'inline') do -%>
  sequence do
    participant 'alfred', :forget => true
    participant 'bob', :forget => true
    participant 'charly', :forget => true
  end
<% end %>
