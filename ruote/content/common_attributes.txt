h2. attributes common to all expressions

The attributes listed on this page may be used with any expression.

* ":timeout":#timeout
* ":if or :unless":#if_unless
* ":forget":#forget
* ":on_error":#on_error
* ":on_cancel":#on_cancel
* ":on_timeout":#on_timeout


h3(#timeout). :timeout

If after two days, the two reviewers couldn't do their work, the process instance will resume to the editor :

<% coderay(:lang => 'ruby', :line_numbers => 'inline') do -%>
  sequence do
    participant :ref => 'author'
    sequence :timeout => '2d' do
      participant :ref => 'reviewer1'
      participant :ref => 'reviewer2'
    end
    participant :ref => 'editor'
  end
<% end %>

:timeout understands h, m, d, s (respectively hour, minute, day, second). It also understands y, M, w (for year, Month and week), but they are rarely used.

It's OK to give an absolute date to the :timeout attribute :

<% coderay(:lang => 'ruby', :line_numbers => 'inline') do -%>
  participant :ref => 'author', :timeout => 'Sun Jan 24 17:28:28 +0900 2010'
<% end %>

But most of the time absolute dates are fetched from process variables or workitem fields :

<% coderay(:lang => 'ruby', :line_numbers => 'inline') do -%>
  participant :ref => 'author', :timeout => '${f:time_limit}'
<% end %>

Please note that "participants":exp/participant.html may have their say in their timeout.

You might also have a look at the ":on_timeout":#on_timeout attribute.
