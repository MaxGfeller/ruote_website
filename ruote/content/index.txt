h3. ruote

<strong>Ruote</strong> is a workflow engine written in Ruby. Ruote is "not":http://jmettraux.wordpress.com/2009/07/03/state-machine-workflow-engine/ a state machine library.

It could be described as an 'operating system for business processes'.

A ruote engine may execute multiple <strong>process instances</strong> at a time. Processes are instantiated from <strong>process definitions</strong> written in a Ruby DSL or in XML (or directly as JSON). Process definitions describe the flow of work among <strong>participants</strong>. Participants stand for users, groups of users, services, legacy systems, etc.


Ruote is available under the "MIT":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License open source license.

Ruote used to be named 'openwfe-ruby' then 'openwferu'. The name is now 'ruote' (pronounce it 'ru-o-te' or 'route', as you wish).

The small "quickstart":quickstart.html might help.
