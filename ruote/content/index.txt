h2. ruote

<strong>Ruote</strong> is a "workflow engine":/wfengine.html written in Ruby.

It could also be described as an 'operating system for business processes'. It is "not":http://jmettraux.wordpress.com/2009/07/03/state-machine-workflow-engine/ a state machine library.

Ruote is available under the "MIT":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License open source license.

Ruote used to be named 'openwfe-ruby' then 'openwferu'. The name is now 'ruote' (pronounce it 'ru-o-te' or 'route', as you wish).
