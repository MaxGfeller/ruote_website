h2. Heading towards ruote 2.0

Ruote 2.0 is an exciting development, and has been a long time in the making, offering a leaner engine with completely reworked internals.

Much of the focus on 2.0 is on being lean, performant and easier to maintain over the long run. A lot of "bulk" that has been part of the pre-2.0 code will extracted into their own gems as well. <a href="http://github.com/kennethkalmer/ruote-amqp">ruote-amqp</a> and <a href="http://github.com/jmettraux/ruote-dm">ruote-dm</a> are the first two extras that have been removed from core.

The old <a href="http://github.com/jmettraux/ruote-rest">ruote-rest</a> project will be replaced by the <a href="http://github.com/kennethkalmer/ruote-kit">ruote-kit</a> project, providing an engine with a RESTful interface.

From the outside little should change. The biggest visible change is the top-level namespace changing from <em>OpenWFE</em> to <em>Ruote</em>. <a href="expressions.html">Expressions</a> and <a href="definitions.html">definitions</a> will remain mostly unchanged, except that Ruby definitions will need to change from <em>OpeWFE::ProcessDefinition</em> to <em>Ruote.process_definition</em> (class definition to method call). A lot of expressions have gained additional options.

The following expressions have been removed:
* Foo expression
* Bar expression

h3. New to ruote?

We encourage you to focus on using ruote 2.0 and report any bugs and issues you come up, and any inconsistencies in the documentation we still have to address.

You can join us any time on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/openwferu-users">mailing list</a> or <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/ruote">#ruote on Freenode</a> for a chat and occasional coffee.

h3. Progress

To monitor the progress you can watch the <a href="http://github.com/jmettraux/ruote/tree/ruote2.0">ruote2.0</a> branch at Github. It contains a TODO.txt file that gets updated as work progresses. Hanging out in IRC is a great way to stay updated as well.

As with all open source projects, we ask for your patience and help as we move towards this goal.
